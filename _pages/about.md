#### Welcome to [Zhuoning Guo (郭茁宁)](https://gzn00417.github.io/) 's homepage!

I'm a $3^{rd}$-year Ph.D. student at [AI Thrust](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en/academics/ai), [Information Hub](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hao Liu (刘浩)](https://raymondhliu.github.io/) and [Prof. Qiang Yang (杨强)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/). I received my bachelor degree of software engineering from [Computing Faculty](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), at June, 2022. My research interests include graph learning, federated learning, large language model, and data mining.

I was a visiting student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/). Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/) and collaborate with [Baidu Talent Intelligence Center](https://ai.baidu.com/solution/recruitment), supervised by [Dr. Hengshu Zhu](https://www.zhuhengshu.com/). At earlier years of undergraduate, I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Shizhao Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6tdI2m0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), an undergraduate intern supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang), and a research assistant supervised by [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia).

During my undergraduate life in HIT, I'm honored as the chairman of [HIT Massive Data Club](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/hlsjjlb/list.htm), captain of Football Team of Computing Faculty, HIT and president of HIT Chess Club.

Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/).
