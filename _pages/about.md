I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My general areas of research are spatio-temporal data mining and applied machine learning, with a focus on developing accurate, scalable, and generalizable algorithms to tackle complex real-world challenges, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability. The long-term goal of my research is to building more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable cities with AI-powered technologies.

I have published over 20 papers in refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as TKDE, VLDBJ, KDD, VLDB, and AAAI. My research has powered several billion-scale online services at DiDi Chuxing and Baidu Maps. I also serve as the program committee member or reviewer for leading conferences and journals, such as KDD, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, and TKDE. I received several awards including HKUST AIS Best Research Award, VLDB Best Research Paper Nomination, and first place in KDD Cup 2018.
