I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My general research interests lie in data mining and applied machine learning, with a focus on developing strong foundation models for smart city services and scientific computing. I have published prolifically in refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as TKDE, VLDBJ, KDD, VLDB, and AAAI. My research works have powered several billion-scale industrial applications in DiDi Chuxing and Baidu Maps. I also serve as the program committee members or reviewers for conferences and journals like ICLR, NeurIPS, KDD, WWW, AAAI, AISTATS, IMWUT, TKDE, and TBD. I received several awards including HKUST AIS best research award, VLDB best paper nomination award, and first place of KDD Cup 2018.
