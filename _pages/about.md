I am currently a Ph.D. student at Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interests lie in data mining and applied machine learning, especially spatio-temporal modeling and PDE solving. The long-term goal of my research is to create strong foundation models from big data that enable intelligent and sustainable cities.

# Research Interests
My current research interests lie in the following aspects:
* Fundamental algorithms: data-centric AI, efficient deep learning, physics-informed learning
* Urban intelligence: urban foundation models, generative city agents
* AI for science: climate modeling and prediction

# News

- \[12/2024\] I successfully passed my PhD defense. Thanks to my advisors and all committee members for their invaluable support and guidance!
- \[12/2024\] One paper on graph unlearning was accepted by **AAAI 2025**.
- \[11/2024\] One paper on graph transfer learning was accepted by **KDD 2025**.
